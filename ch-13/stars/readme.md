![Demo image of stars game](https://github.com/aklap/python-crash-course/blob/master/ch-13/stars/stars.png)

Another side side project from Python Crash Course. Scatter the stars across the pygame window. Turns out 'random' isn't so random, hence the column of stars. However, met the specs :)

## Uses:

* pygame
* Python 3

## Specs (from book):

* Create rows of stars
* Fill the window
* Try to randomize placement of each star 

## To run:

Install pygame in project directory with `pip3 install pygame`.

Run with `python3 run_game.py`

Quit with 'Q' key.
