![Demo of Rain app](https://github.com/aklap/python-crash-course/blob/master/ch-13/rain/demo.gif)

A side project for Ch-13 to simulate falling rain drops. Slightly tweaked from the instructions in the book.

## Uses:

* pygame
* Python 3.7.1

## Specs (from book):

* Looping image of raindrops
* Position them randomly at top
* Should not end; once raindrops hit bottom of screen, more should appear at the top
