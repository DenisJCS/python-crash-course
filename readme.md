# Python Crash Course

This repo contains most of the exercises from [Eric Matthes' Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse) all done in Python 3.7.1. (I skipped the data viz chapter and most of the Pygal stuff.)

For some of the larger projects, esp. the side projects where you're left without instruction I included demo images and gifs. (Hopefully this helps anyone stuck on certain exercises in the book.)

## Notes
Most of the latter chapters' exercises contain outdated instructions for Django apps, particularly Pygal exercises and APIs, some of the imported django modules and using Whitenoise. 

For some of the projets the specs wanted more of a CRU rather than a CRUD app. I added the ability to delete objects in the database via the app, anyway.

Learning Log and the Blog projects have their own repos.
