# Python Crash Course

This repo contains most of the exercises from Eric Matthes' Python Crash Course all done in Python 3.7.1. (I skipped the data viz chapter and most of the Pygal stuff.)

## Notes
Most of the latter chapters' exercises contain outdated instructions for Django apps, particularly Pygal exercises and APIs, some of the imported django modules and using Whitenoise. 

Learning Log and the Blog projects have their own repos.
