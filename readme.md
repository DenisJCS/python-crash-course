# Python Crash Course

This repo contains most of the exercises from [Eric Matthes' Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse) all done in Python 3.7.1. (Sections I skipped include the data visualization chapter and most of the Pygal projects and some of the outdated API projects.)

For some of the larger projects, esp. the side projects where there are specs but no instructions, I also included a readme, demo images, and gifs. (Hopefully this helps anyone stuck on certain exercises in the book!)

## Notes
The latter chapters' exercises contain outdated instructions/resources for Django apps, particularly the Pygal exercises and APIs (fyi: weatherunderground.com doesn't seem to provide historical data in a CSV format, anymore), as well as some of the imported Django modules and Whitenoise.

For some of the projects the specs wanted more of a CRU rather than a CRUD app. I added the ability to delete objects in the database via the app, anyway.

Alien Invasion game, Learning Log and the Blog projects will have their own repos.
